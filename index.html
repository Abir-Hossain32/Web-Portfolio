                Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs,  ideas through the senses.Artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early pre-historic art to contemporary art; however, some theorists feel that the typical concept of "artistic works" fits less well outside modern Western societies.

            <p class="container">
                A pastime is any hobby or activity that you do to pass the time. Usually, people enjoy their pastimes.So,I do art whenever i get time to pass my boring time or to make my mind jolly.I've been doing sketches since class 9 but the skill was developed earlier in kindergarten.
